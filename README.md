# LeetCode Solutions - February 2025

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems solved in February 2025. The solutions are implemented in C++ and focus on providing just the function implementations that LeetCode accepts. Each solution is accompanied by a brief description of the problem it solves.

## Solution Format

Each solution is provided in a separate file with the following structure:

 ``` cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      // Function signature
      ReturnType functionName(Parameters) {
          // Implementation
      }
  };
  ```

class Solution: Contains the function that solves the problem.
Function signature: Matches the signature expected by LeetCode.
Implementation: Contains the logic to solve the problem.
